# IntunewinBuilder

## Description

Intunewinbuilder is an application designed to prepare and decrypt *.intunewin files. The application allows you to quickly and easily build and decrypt an *.intunewin file

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Minimum 4MB of disk space ;)

## Installation
The IntunewinBuilde application is installed using a standard msi file

## How it works?

### Preparing the *.intunewin file
1. Launch the Intunewin Builder application (desktop shortcut)
2. Select button for the "Source setup file" field, a dialog box will open where you should indicate the source file.
3. After indicating the source file, the Source folder and Output folder fields will be filled in automatically. The output folder can be changed by selecting the button next to this field
4. After specifying the source file, the size of the source directory will be checked to see if it does not exceed 30GB. If the file size exceeds 30GB, it will not be possible to build the *intunewin file.
